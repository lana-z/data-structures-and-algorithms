### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`

I've added new files to this folder for the day's assigned code challenges.

I ran `npm install` from within this folder to setup my system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run my tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all of the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

- I am following instructions specific to my 401 language (python), which can be found in the directory below, matching my course.
