# Tree Fizz Buzz

This project implements a function to play FizzBuzz taking in a k-ary Tree and returning a new K-ary Tree.

Features:
- [KaryTree](/python/data_structures/kary_tree.py)
  - breadth_first
  - clone
- [Binary Tree](/python/data_structures/binary_tree.py)
  - fizz_buzz_tree


## Whiteboard Process
![Whiteboard](/python/docs/tree_fizz_buzz/codechal-18.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Reviewed the example, pseudocode and tests provided, whiteboarded test cases and visualized the output. Added the code then used chatgpt to assist on Big O analysis.

#### Resources:

- [Code Fellows' Trees Tutorial and breadth_first pseudocode](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)
- JB's intro and Kary tree class(/python/data_structures/kary_tree.py)


#### Big O

##### BinaryTree
Time Complexity:

Space Complexity:
