# Linked List
This project is to implement a linked list using clean, reusable code according to the Single-responsibility principle.

Features
- Node Class: a basic unit with a value and a pointer to the next node.
- Linked List Class: manages the nodes, with methods to insert new nodes at the head with O(1) time complexity, check if a value exists in the list, and convert the list to a string representation.
  - Methods:
    - insert
    - includes
    - to string

It raises custom error messages and tests to prove the functionality.
